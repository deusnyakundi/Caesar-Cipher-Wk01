# Caeser Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies
and generals. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.

This application implements the technique on command prompt to take user input and encrypt the message with 
a private key.
